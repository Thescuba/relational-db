    "### Text and string types\n",
    "* text - like str type in python but writen in 'single quotes'\n",
    "* char(n) — a string of exactly n characters.\n",
    "* varchar(n) — a string of up to n characters.\n",
    "### Numeric types\n",
    "* integer - like int type in python but with different limits\n",
    "* real — a floating-point value, like Python float. Accurate up to six decimal places.\n",
    "* double precision — a higher-precision floating-point value. Accurate up to 15 decimal places.\n",
    "* decimal — an exact decimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Date and time types\n",
    "* date — a calendar date; including year, month, and day.\n",
    "* time — a time of day.\n",
    "* timestamp — a date and time together.\n",
    "**hint:** Always put 'single quotes' around text strings and date/time values. example '2012-11-23' can be read as a string or a date while 2012-11-23 will be read as a mathamatical expression ((2012 - 11) - 23) which returns 1978.\n",

    "The keyword SELECT tell us which field/columns we are interested in pulling from the database. The FROM keyword is telling us where we will pulling our data, as in which table. They WHERE keyword acts as a filter and a select clasuse, in the case above we want to filter our results to only gorillas which are named Max\n",

    "* WHERE - Used as a filter to take in value that matter\n",
    "* LIMIT - return only a certain number of rows with option to OFFSET which allows to assign row to start at after filtering \n",
    "* ORDER BY - Sort results by a colummn with default is ascending order but also option for decending as DESC\n",

    "Two additional keywords to cover:\n",
    "* AS - Allows us to name new columns\n",
    "* GROUP BY - The group by clause is only used with aggregations, such as max or count. Without a group by clause, a select statement with an aggregation will aggregate over the whole selected table(s), returning only one row. With a group by clause, it will return one row for each distinct value of the column or expression in the group by clause.\n",
    "* HAVING - The having clause works like the where clause, but it applies after group by aggregations take place.\n",
    "* INSERT INTO -  Insert new row into table. A single insert statement can only insert into a single table. (Contrast this with the select statement, which can pull data from several tables using a join.)\n",
