We have an app with pictures and we want our users to vote for their favorite. Say now that we are interested in which cat got the most votes. With SQL we can do that in just a few lines of code but lets get the high level understanding done first. The first thing we may want to do is sub the Votes tables with the names of the cats from our Pictures table."
