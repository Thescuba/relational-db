    "One thing to always remember is that when we do a query using the keyword insert, we must also commit our changes to the database. Image we were writing an accounting system and we wanted to pull \\\\$100 from your account and put \\\\$100 into Kims account. We might do changes to two different tables but the key takeaways is that we want both to take place at the same time or if something goes wrong we want neither to take effect. Also say that another user was viewing the database we would never want them to see one change and not the other. When we make changes such as insert to our database they go into something called transaction, when we call commit the transaction actually takes effect. If we close the connection without commiting our changes will be rolled back. This means that none of our changed will have taken place."
